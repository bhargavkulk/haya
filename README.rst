 Haya
======

Haya is a python package for static site generation. It depends on

- ``docutils`` to convert ``.rst`` content files into HTML.
- ``mako`` to enable templating of content into HTML
- ``libscss`` to enable SCSS compilation

Future Features
****************

- blogs
- assets other than CSS files
- themes? seems unnecessary
